ADMW - AWS Data Migration Workflow üì¶
======================================
- A data migration pipeline built on several AWS services.
- From **flat file** to **relational database**.
- Data is processed in parallel using AWS Glue and Spark to decrease the time needed to extract, load, and transform data.

Two-Stage Migration Process ‚è©
-------------------------------
**Preliminary Stage**

#. Reads data from a flat file and perform any needed data transformations on the data. 
#. Loads the transformed data into a preliminary table (contains additional columns for status tracking and data integrity checks).
#. Generates a report of the data migration process.

**Final Stage**

#. Moves data from the preliminary table to the final table (finalised schema with the addition of a source file name column).
#. Generates a report of the data migration process.
#. Compresses and stores source file.

**Global Features**

#. A tracking table in RDS instance is continually updated to aid in monitoring of a data migration process.
#. Report summaries are sent via email using SNS.
#. Users are notified of any errors occurring during a migration process via email.
#. A Jupyter notebook is provided to allow developers to create and test both transformation and reconcilation logic easily.
